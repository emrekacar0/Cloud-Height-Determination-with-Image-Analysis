# Cloud-Height-Determination-with-Image-Analysis
This code determines cloud height distribution for agitated slurries containing more than one type of solid particles, which is hard to model that environment with CFD. The code uses image analysis tools for calculation. It accepts video recordings of a mixing operation for a slurry and determines the cloud height distribution for each image. The code gives an average cloud distribution for entire video as an output.
